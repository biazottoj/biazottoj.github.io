        <h1>Tool support for software maintenance</h1>

        <p>
            We are researchers in the field of software engineering at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Our objective is to better understand your views regarding the utilization of tools for facilitating software maintenance in practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            To help us, you can answer one or more of five short surveys (approx. 5-8 minutes each).
        </p>

        <p>
            Each survey addresses a specific scenario illustrating a tool usage:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A <b>bot</b> that labels issues based on issue text:                           <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/oYTyxhbhirTaMgY3A">https://forms.gle/oYTyxhbhirTaMgY3A</a></li>
            <li>A <b>dashboard</b> that presents the amount of code smells and technical debt: <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/Jc6fsAeh2VsAHLe29">https://forms.gle/Jc6fsAeh2VsAHLe2</a></li>

            <li>A <b>bot</b> that facilitates code review in Github pull requests:             <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/bZkSBcjbXfmfavQ48">https://forms.gle/bZkSBcjbXfmfavQ48</a></li>
        </ul>

        

<p>Among other goals, we aim to build and help others build support tools that are driven by the added value for the developer. </p>
